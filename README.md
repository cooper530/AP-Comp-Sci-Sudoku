# AP-Comp-Sci-Sudoku
This project uses the Java console to create the classic game of sudoku.

## How to Play
The same rules of Sudoku apply. One must fill the board so that each number only appears once
in the row, column and region.

Currently, there are 4 pre-loaded boards in the program. To play, specify the position you would like to place a number (column, row). Then type your number (1-9). If that number is not final, you can display it as a "proposed"
value. It will be signified by ' '. 

Also, if you wish to discard a value that you previously entered, you may enter -1 into the correct row and column. This will effectively remove the previous number and replace it with a blank slot.

You will win the game when the board is completely filled.
