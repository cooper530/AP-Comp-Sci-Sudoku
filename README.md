# AP-Comp-Sci-Sudoku
This project uses the Java console to create the classic game of sudoku.

##How to Play
The same rules of Sudoku apply. One must fill the board so that each number only appears once
in the row, column and region.

There are 2 different modes to choose from, Random Mode and Normal Mode.

### Random Mode
This option generates a randomized board for the user to solve. This mode is slightly harder, but offers
more boards to solve.

### Normal Mode
This option uses one of the 10 predefined boards in the BoardsList class. This mode has easier boards, but can
get repetitive after solving them multiple times.
