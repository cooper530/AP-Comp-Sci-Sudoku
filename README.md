# AP-Comp-Sci-Sudoku
This project uses the Java console to create the classic game of sudoku.

## How to Play
The same rules of Sudoku apply. One must fill the board so that each number only appears once
in the row, column and region.

Currently, there are 4 pre-loaded boards in the program. To play, specify the position you would like to place a number (column, row). Then
type your number (1-9). If that number is not final, you can display it as a "proposed"
value. It will be signified by ' '. You will win the game when the board is completely
filled.
